# Google Clone (HTML & CSS)

This is a simple clone of the Google homepage built using **HTML and CSS only**.  
It was created as part of my web development learning journey to practice layouts and styling.

## Features
- Google logo and search bar
- Search and "I'm Feeling Lucky" buttons
- Footer with links (like the original Google homepage)

## How to Run
1. Download or clone this repository.
2. Open `index.html` in your browser.
